-lab3.cpp
-filter.h
-filter.cpp
-CMakeLists.txt

Open a terminal in the directory and do the following operation:
1) cmake .
2) make all
3) ./Lab3 data

The program uses 1 command line argument (argv[1]) to get:
the Path of the folder containing the images (for example: data ).

If there will not be 1 command line arguments there will be considered the following path as default:
../data

There is a menu to get a user friendly execution:
    - choose 1 image among the list shown
    - choose which channel among HSV to equalize
    - choose how you want to see the equalization results
    - choose the type of filter to apply
        When you finish with one of them you can test also the other until you want
        (To finish press 0, or a not valid menu number)



I used CLion on Linux Mint to write the code for this homework.
