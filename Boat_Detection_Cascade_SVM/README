CODE:
    Main:
        - project.cpp

    Class Utility Methods:
        - datasetPreparation_utils.h

    Class BoundingBox:
        - BoundingBox.h
        - BoundingBox.cpp

    Class BoatImage:
        - BoatImage.h
        - BoatImage.cpp

    Class CombinedModel:
        - CombinedModel.h
        - CombinedModel.cpp

DIRECTORIES:
    models: contains the .xml of the models used during the test
    Cascade: I created it in case the user would like to perform the training of it's cascade classifier (that will be saved on it's sub-directory called "data")
    SVM: contains the subdirectories that will contains the training set (positive and negative in order to train an SVM)
    


TO DO:
Open a terminal in the directory and do the following operation:
1) cmake .
2) make all
3) ./Project   



EXECUTION:
The program is composed by a Men√π:
 1- Create the dataset for the training of the cascade of Classifiers (Not necessary because the project already contains the .xml of cascade)
 2- Create Dataset For SVM training and then trained it (Not necessary because the project already contains the .xml of the svm trained)
 3- Test the model on the Test Set


During the execution The user can choose one of the 3 options of execution and He will be asked to insert some paths (below I will report some examples that I used):
 Task 1: -Insert the Path of the directory with the training Images:
          Example: /home/luca/Scrivania/final/FINAL_DATASET/TRAINING_DATASET/IMAGES
         -Insert the Path of the directory with the training labels:
          Example: /home/luca/Scrivania/final/FINAL_DATASET/TRAINING_DATASET/LABELS_TXT

 Task 2: -Insert the Path of the directory with the training Images:
          Example: /home/luca/Scrivania/final/FINAL_DATASET/TRAINING_DATASET/IMAGES

 Task 3: -Insert the Path of the directory with the Test Images:
          Example: /home/luca/Scrivania/final/FINAL_DATASET/TEST_DATASET/venice
         -Insert the Path of the directory with the Test labels:
          Example: /home/luca/Scrivania/final/FINAL_DATASET/TEST_DATASET/venice_labels_txt




MESSAGES:
- If the Paths inserted are wrong there will be a message "Wrong Paths inserted".


I used CLion on Linux Mint to write the code for this homework.
