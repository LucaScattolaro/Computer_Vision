Open a terminal in the directory and do the following operation:
1) cmake .
2) make all
3) ./Lab5 datasets/data    

The program uses 1 command line argument (argv[1]) to get:
the Path of the folder containing the images (for example: datasets/dolomites ).

If there will not be 1 command line arguments there will be considered the following path as default:
../datasets/data

EXECUTION:
The user has to insert some values during the execution:
-Insert the value of the angle
   (Dolomites: 27)
   (others: 33)
-Insert the ratio value to choose the good matches

MESSAGES:
- If the ratio inserted is too small (there are no good_matches between 2 images) the program will finish with the message:
  "Ratio choosen it's too small...Please re-run the code using a bigger value"
- If the path passed as argument or the one used as default is not correct the program will finish withe the message:
  "The Path used is worng!"



I used CLion on Linux Mint to write the code for this homework.
